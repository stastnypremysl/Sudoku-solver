# Sudoku-solver
HTML5 sudoku solver

This project was done in 2016. 
It worked under Chrome and Firefox, but there are many problems with up-to-date broswers. 

## Getting started

    git clone https://github.com/stastnypremysl/Sudoku-solver
    firefox ./Sudoku-solver/public_html/index.html
    
First of all, you need to fill in the sudoku puzzle. 
After that click to the button in the top right corner, and the sudoku should be solved.
This should work, even if there is more than one solution.
